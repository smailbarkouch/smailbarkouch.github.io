        Model prompt >>> What are you?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
         (Duck).
        
        What are you doing? (Duck).
        
        Oh, that was one of those things that I just went and asked myself. I think there's a lot of other people out there who have this, you know, one thing they're doing better now; they're better. You know, you've seen it. We're in the NFL. I've been on the field before. I've been involved with the team when I could, you know, go, "Wow. That's really good work out there."
        
        But yeah, it's good to be out there and that's what makes you so good; it helps you in a lot of ways. The thing that I noticed at every corner you're coming out, is that if you give guys opportunities, they feel comfortable with it.
        
        When I started, when I thought I was going to play, everybody just kind of stopped. I think that changed over the course of your career if you're successful. You know, people, guys like Tim Welker, the way you approach your offense and how you keep it organized. The way you run your personnel staff, the way you move the team.
        
        Yeah, you know, I mean what's the problem? What's the opportunity?
        
        So I think we're just not getting any better.
        
        Really?
        
        That's just a good thing. You know, I mean as I pointed out, for some guys, it takes so much time to develop, sometimes it takes so long to grow.
        
        You know, some guys, even just as I showed you, the coaching staff has to be on your side, because you're not getting good.
        
        And you're not getting the best at what you need. You're not getting the best that you're ever getting, and I mean obviously, you have to put your body on edge and be that guy, where all the time it's so hard to get better. It's not so hard for you, it's not all the time.
        
        That's just to be like, I would rather it be that way right now, than in the future.
        
        It's not what you got now, and I really like the philosophy and the way you operate. But I think in all our games, we have to put our body on edge and be ready for the next guy, when they've got a chance here. You always have to play the game so you can handle,

        Model prompt >>> What is the meaning of life?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
        
        
        If you've ever used a piece of music you can understand what is meant by that music. It is an essential meaning in music and it is vital to a piece of music. A piece is a symbol or concept.
        
        There is no other meaning of life besides being alive if you like it. Therefore, if you can say that life is meaning, then you should say that life is life.
        
        What is your meaning to life?
        
        If we have lived with a piece of music, our goal is to live with it for a lifetime. If we do not have the time, we might lose our memories and lose our connection with this piece.
        
        I know that life is very important. Life is vital to you and your life, you will always feel it. You have all these things that you are trying to live for.
        
        I know that living with a piece of music, life that you are trying to live for is very difficult but it is what you deserve to be happy for. This is why I choose to have an important piece of music.
        
        That is why if anyone wants me to listen to it, then I will listen to the music. This means that I get to listen to it because this piece is important for us, which is why I choose this piece of music.
        
        The piece is the life that we live in but the music that we choose to leave it, so to speak.
        
        I will also hear you saying, if I love you, I will listen and feel a certain love for you, but I will leave this piece of music to you and your life will become less important than you think it is to me.
        
        A piece of music, to me, is the life that we live in. It must give you a meaningful outlet and a way to express yourself. It is for this piece of music that I want that life be meaningful to me. A piece of music that makes you want to live for this piece of music.
        
        It would be nice to have that life.
        
        Do not just listen to the music, but read the written content. Do not wait for that piece of music. Even if it doesn't give you an authentic feeling for life, you should read it and then experience it yourself.
        
        Life isn't something you buy or buy things from, but the material means you feel for it. If you take care of it yourself, then it's worth investing you money in it.
        
        I

        Model prompt >>> Is life precious?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
         Does all life come from God?" (Hebrews 11:24)
        
        The following is one of the many scriptures of the LDS church to be found by Latter-day Saints in my home at the Salt Lake Temple. I would like to include a few of them.
        
        1. God created mankind; and that He created him; and to His glory they gave him life. The scriptures record that God created Adam, Eve, and every other creature in heaven and on earth and even the sea. But man did not produce these creatures by his own will alone. Adam made the first humans, and these creatures became men and women through the sexual union of their minds, heart and hands. God made each of the creatures to be men and women "in the midst of their flesh;" (Acts 1:29–32) and to be men, and to be women—this being was the reason why man should not be created. (Acts 8:28–29) There is a great discrepancy between what's reported from Genesis 1:19 and what is written in the Book of Mormon in the Pearl of Great Price. In Genesis 1:19 the Lord revealed that every creature male and female was created in a natural way for the purpose of perpetuating his or her name. It says that man had sex with a woman before he became a man in the flesh, but was created to take his name by his love toward her; hence it says that man is the one creation. "I tell you, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall establish the earth on the face of the Earth, both female and male, as His own; and the earth upon the face of the Earth shall bear all these things which He has revealed on the face of the Father (D&C 37:1–10), but on the side which shall never be known." (Hebrews 11:27)
        
        2. God created men and women by His own desire and pleasure in themselves. This definition of sexuality includes both male and female, and is what I find most pertinent to the topic of "God's creation of man and woman." I think it is a good point to draw in your mind to the statement that this definition "will bring God to His glory." Again, this is true. God did not create any man and woman in the universe. It is what we have been told throughout the scriptures to think. You need a certain level of understanding to understand this. It does not mean that we should be
        ================================================================================
        Model prompt >>> When is something truly alive?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
        What has its soul?

        It can be argued that there is no such thing, and that life itself has no such thing. This is simply not true. It is true that life exists, and that one ought not to confuse it with existence, especially for those who consider that life has no such thing as being; that one ought not to be in the world from which this existence derives, and to what existence it derives from the world. Life (at least in the sense of existence) is not a world, no matter how much one may perceive it and think it to be. (The mind as an animal would be in a world, and a human being could be an animal, but it would not be alive. Therefore a person would not be alive. It would just be something.)

        There may be no such thing as being, only that which is life and exists. And one can, even though a creature cannot speak freely, still be subject to any measure of pleasure, and in all cases will be happy, for any satisfaction there must consist in the existence of another being. It is one way of knowing that this is true, and how far is it from it.

        But life is not a world. No good can reside in such a body as it would be in one born without that body.

        Thus we say that there is no such thing as being, because life, and all other things of the same kind, differ from the world; so when one makes the same question, the other becomes confused. So that one who cannot understand things in one way must either be indifferent about them in another, or be indifferent about them in this world, or be indifferent about them in one of those other worlds. What is the difference between a being and a being only that one is able to understand?

        Again, a being that can conceive a form does have its form.

        In a world with no creatures, no other thing exists; but a creature with a body and body, which we would call a being that one has but only as its form. What does it mean? A creature, we would call the matter of creation, is something of the things that God created.

        Now, the matter of creation, if we can use it of the world with which we are acquainted, is a thing that we understand, not simply for its existence and that of all living things, but for its existence that there exists something other than the thing we know. It appears to us like

        Model prompt >>> What will human society look like in 2050?
======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 Well, it isn't even possible to figure it out. Even in advanced economies, the current world-view seems to be the opposite of what governments or people on the streets should be seeing.

The real test of a civilization will be whether or not it will survive. The people in the next generation are already struggling with that and trying to determine what they expect. But the next generation will have the chance to test if societies and individuals have the same potential. This means building a better future that's truly human. If we want a better future for those who work hard to develop the future, that means building a community. We want democracy and respect – even to the extent of the law and tradition, especially in some cases. And if some people disagree with that view and want an end to the debate, then they will vote for others who do not.

The problem with political parties in politics today is that politicians often use "social contract" to describe society and to disguise how it will work. These contracts, the "social contract," are often the very opposite of how governments can be designed.

What is the best way to build a better future for all humans?

That was the question that we had for three years when the global financial crisis hit. I'm sure that many people around the world took note of what we were seeing and wanted to hear about it: A world without a third world problem is not possible. And that is why we should not be expecting any good outcomes on the economic and social fronts.

Let me be very clear and clear. Let's not judge a world without a third world problem by comparing it to a two-stage economy or economy in any economic sense that might exist at some date, like the one in your own country, or an economy in some other country. We should be making the case for the best way we can build a better future for all humans, not just for those who play by the rules and who act in accordance with those rules.<|endoftext|>On Saturday, it became a bit of a revelation that Trump is considering to nominate the infamous "Make America Great Again" campaign manager to lead the Democratic National Committee after former President Barack Obama failed to hold the position of chairman in 2008.

That nomination is being considered but many speculate that Trump may not actually be voting for Hillary Clinton's bid.

Here's what Bernie Sanders, the former democratic socialist, said Saturday night, as he addressed the Nevada caucus: "I've asked Trump about the status

Model prompt >>> Pretend you are Barack Obama. Give a speech about accepting your 3rd presidential term.
======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 Then send your 3rd Congressional Campaign Committee to the GOP, including Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Chuck Grassley and others.

As President Obama has said, if you refuse to take your place, they will appoint your successor to the Senate. And if you do, then the Senate can take over. In the end, he'll be nominated by a Republican. So it's very, very important and very important to get out there, to get the vote for him.

There's a good chance that's going to happen — it's going to happen this week in Iowa. It's not because of any of the races, but because of the circumstances of the state that we have.

There are a lot of people who want change. And so our job is to look at other ways to get change happen in a way that makes sense for the people of Iowa and for the country.

(APPLAUSE)

Q Thank you very much. And here's another question.

If the Supreme Court is made up of three justices, would you vote to strike that down?

MR. TANN: Well, I certainly would. And if this goes to war, we should do so. I was going to say it right here but I think that's one way.

Our focus is on the long term — we've been focused on the long term. Right now, the United States has three big problems: unemployment, stagnant wages and the continuing recession.

Because we don't have a long term picture of whether it's the right thing to do, so to speak. But if the president can change the course of history, then it will be possible. What we're doing is we're going to have a long term picture of this, and we're doing it based on the fact that there is a strong, strong, solid economy. We're seeing things that are good for working people and not good for the economy. So let's talk about this. If there are three justices, for instance, who say their job is not to create jobs nor serve the citizens, that is their job, and we'll not be doing that.

If, on the other hand, we have three justices who say they don't have a job, then they're out of this job, we'll be out of this job, and we're leaving behind a weak, stagnant economy and what's going to be a very bad future.

Q I'd like to ask you

Model prompt >>> If AI becomes too advanced, will it threaten humanity's existance?
======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
 Will these new algorithms make things even more unpredictable, or will they just continue existing in a relatively untested manner, which doesn't make them worth having to deal with?

One of the most surprising things about AI is its power. Imagine a scenario where your algorithm has its head started and says "Okay, this is a puzzle to solve. I want to solve it on my own terms; will it come up with a better answer to each question? I want one more question to explain why it came up with the answer I want to answer. I want an explanation of how to make things work differently, why I choose a specific time and place when making this puzzle, and so on. How can I deal with this more efficiently if I get it wrong?"

There are many, many more possibilities when it comes to understanding the world around you, but for myself, it's just a matter of figuring out the best way to tackle each one.

And it's not a game, though it looks like one. You're looking for something that will play well, if not, at least will play well enough.

As we've seen this time earlier, AI takes over the world. It's been working on solving things for decades, but it continues to move on at an ever-increasing pace. The idea behind "AI" is that it's the culmination of centuries of research, collaboration and discovery. As each team moves towards solving questions, it eventually starts to develop tools and algorithms to solve more complex questions. In an interview with me, Microsoft's chief scientist and founder Brendan Iribe described the current state of AI as an "AI revolution":

I'm really excited about this, you know, a lot of the work that's going on in [AI] right now is starting to come out of its research and it's a very exciting technology. It is a breakthrough, but it is going to take time before it actually goes all the way out in a human-level way. Even with that, I suspect it could, in the end, be a significant disruption for society. (Source)

While the potential disruption is small, we're at the beginning of our era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, so the reality for this particular type of problem is that things like the Internet are not going to go away anytime soon, so we have a good chance of seeing a real world in which AI is a real possibility (the first ever example), too.

The AI Revolution Is A Change
