Not all effort is worth the same. Working really hard doesn’t guarantee success, which is why nuance matters when deciding where to direct your attention. That means doing the research and understanding what you’re doing before you do it. But often, you’ll fail - and then what? You keep going, learn from your mistakes, and take the necessary steps toward success.
I sometimes avoid writing things like this because I worry they’re too obvious, but much like clichés, they’re obvious for a reason: there’s truth in them. 
Your response to a situation dictates your direction in life. When something negative happens and your response is to wallow or turn to self-destruction - whether inward or outward - you’ll face more difficulty ahead. But when you face adversity with understanding and use the experience to grow, you set yourself on a better path. It’s not easy - I certainly know - but it’s a lesson worth remembering.
