Very often do we find it difficult to remember all that we need to do. Whether it be in the realm of school, work, or our personal lives. That is why having a "second-mind" is so important. A "second-mind" is what people, who use note-taking apps, call their notes when they use it as if it was an extension of their mind. It helps you keep track of where you are at in your life, and cataloges that information so that you can look back at it. I think it's unfortunate that people often characterize note-taking apps as a way to just take their class notes, or work notes. It can be so much more than that. When someone employs note-taking apps effectively, its an edge on their lives.

Although you should dictate to what degree your note-taking app will be used as your "second-mind," I find that it works especially well when you use it as place to store your thoughts and your goals. 

Thoughts can be anything, whether it be little ideas that you have, to wisdom you want to preserve. I find that I often forget some of the best pieces of knowledge that I have, and go through life re-learning them. I like to quote a sentence I heard from somewhere that really resonates with me, "those who forget history are doomed to repeat it." This is exactly the same with life. When someone does not learn life's lessons from experience, they are doomed to experience those lessons again. Thus, it is best that one cataloges what they experience, and what they gain. When they do, not only will they be a more mindful person, but at the same time, are constantly growing. This directly ties into the topic of wisdom as well. Wisdom not only arises from experience, but moments of inspriation. I believe it is worth it to capture these moments for later, and that is why I also catalog this information.

Besides thoughts, it's also worth it to also capture one's goals. Goals are whatever you hope to achieve, in whatever time span. Personally, I write goals for the day, the week, and much further, as far as 20 years down the line. If someone hopes to achieve their goals, they need to have a plan. I find very often, that people, although motiviated to achieve a goal, often don't activately take steps to achieve those goals. I'm speaking from experience, I used to go through the motions of life without clear direction towards my goal. When someone writes down their goals, they have a concrete idea of what they are moving towards. In addition, it also gives someone the chance to find out what they need to do to achieve that goal. The concrete steps towards it. Making that person all the more likely to achieve that goal.

There is a lot more I can give towards the topic of having a "second-mind," although I will save that for future posts. This is mainly something I wanted to get out as practice towards writing blogs. Something I hope to do a lot more of in the up-coming year. A lot of my thoughts regarding this topic, came from the fact that I am co-founder of a note-taking company called Lockbook. Lockbook is an open source note-taking application that focuses on security, privacy, and performance.
