The brain produces a mixture of thoughts and emotions. Often, there's so much going on in our mind, it's hard to think clearly. Like many others, I've found that writing is a great way to gather one's thoughts. When people do this for the events surrounding their lives, it's called a diary or a journal. But you can take it a little step further. 

You can use your notes for all of life's purposes. Imagine everything you've learned in one place. All your class notes, work notes, and thoughts/wisdom in one place digitally. What you have now is what people have referred to as a **second brain**. In that, it is an extension of your mind that helps you retrieve information in a way that complements your own cognitive processes. These "second brain" applications are often hailed as unique and revolutionary note-taking products, Notion for instance. They provide a way to efficiently organize your notes, and must have a powerful search tool. An important attribute I value in these products is cross-platform support. If I want to use my phone to jot a thought, and decide to do some more serious writing, I should be able to use my laptop.

I digress, this sort of note-taking is powerful. It's all of your life's knowledge at your fingertips. Of course you should know and remember many of the things you put into your notes, but no one can remember everything. Everyone is fallible. When you set up a mechanism to retrieve lost information, a backup storage for the mind, i.e. a second brain, what you have is constant growth. **"Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it" - George Santayana**.
