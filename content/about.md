ðŸ‘‹ **Hey! I'm Smail Barkouch.**

I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Rutgers University.

I am a founding engineer at [Lockbook](https://lockbook.net), an [open source](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook) note-taking platform centered around privacy and security.

I've created many open source projects in machine learning, mobile app development, and databases.

Fun fact, I'm a member of the Salsa club and Brazilian jiu jitsu club at Rutgers.
